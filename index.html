        <h3 class="text-light display 1"> CSCI 1300 Responsive Redesign</h3>
        <h6> Purpose/Context: To redesign a website that was previously poorly designed. Goals are to improve responsiveness in varying screen sizes and increase accessibilty features. </h6>
        <p>
        Design Choices: I chose to display the project in a single page scroll format. The menu bar allows you to jump
        quickly to the desired location. This layout allows for simplicity and is easy to follow. While it may
        not be the prettiest design, it is simple and efficient and allows the reader
        to focus on the work iteself and not all of extraneous pieces of the site. 

        Lessons Learned: This project allowed me to gain valualbe insight into the accessibility and 
        usablity of online platforms. I was able to make a previously difficult to read website more readable.
        I can also take away conepts and strategies that had both positvie and negative results that can be applied
        to my work in the future.

                Usability Problems:
            </h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <b>Usability:</b>
                <li>This site is somewhat useful depending on the goal. It is also tough to use because of the three
                    phone numbers and poorly lit coloring on some parts of the page.</li>
                <b>Learnability:</b>
                <li> Currently the learnability is very poor as buttons are poorly arranged and information is hard to
                    find. Additionally the multiple phone numbers are confusing.
                </li>
                <b>Memorability:</b>
                <li>Nothing sticks out when it comes to memorability. Everytime you go back to the site, it feels like
                    you have never seen the webpage before.
                </li>
                <b>Conceptual Model:</b>
                <li>I do not think the designer of this website had the user in mind. It is very difficult to navigate
                    and not at all intuitive.
                </li>
                <b>Specific Problems:</b>
                <li>There are multiple poorly laid out phone numbers scattered throughout the page.</li>
                <li>There is no link/button to make an appointment even when that is necessary for some people (for
                    example if your last passport was issued before your 16th birthday or you need your first passport.
                </li>
                <li>There is no information on the actual process of getting a new passport without multiple clicks
                </li>
                <li>In a small window the map covers the hours.
                </li>
                <li>There are no hours listed for Sunday.
                </li>
                <li>There is an excess of white space at the bottom of the page.
                </li>
                <li>Overall, there is a very poor layout with poor color and spacing elements.
                </li>
                <li>When you hover over the buttons, they barely change color which is hard to see.
                </li>
                <li>The site contains links that are not clickable (passports and visas.com)
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

    <section id="accessibility">
        <div>
            <p>
                Overall, there were 38 accessibility errors and 10 alerts which are concerning when it comes to
                accessibility.
                Most of the errors had to do with links. There were 33 contrast errors surrounding links which would
                make it very hard for users to read the site. Additionally, many images had the same alternative text
                which tells me that it is not descriptive enough and reflects poorly on accessibility. Additionally,
                there were only three features that seemed to improve accessibility and they were in regards to language
                (however the button to change languages was not obvious). Overall, I agree with the detected problems as
                the links are hard to distinguish and the features are hard to find.
